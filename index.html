                            <p>Rest and relaxation invariably lead to healthy sleep. 
                                Yoga will teach you to switch off from problems, 
                                to immerse youself in a calm state.

                                Yoga develops muscle strength and endurance. While you 
                                are practicing yoga, your muscles grow and your bones and 
                                ligaments strengthen.

                        <p>
                            We are an astanga yoga school that tries to teach in a traditional way so students 
                            can progress at their own pace. We offer quality, compassionate teaching. We try to 
                            ensure everyone feels welcome as we feel the idea of a supportive community is very 
                            important. We usually work with hands-on adjustment: if you feel uncomfortable 
                            with this, just let us know: no question or judgement.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our shala is named 'Dharma Shala' inspired by the story of an ancient Indian king 
                            called Ashoka who built many 'dharma shalas' to support wandering yogis. We hope 
                            our dharma shala will be a supportive place for you.
